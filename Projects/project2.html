                <p class="project-detail-body">
                    Stillness explores how internal states like trust, fear and certainty
                    shape both NPC and player behaviour over time. Instead of fixed narrative branches,
                    the game models how characters update their perception of the player and the world
                    based on what they see, remember and believe.

                    Built as a systemic narrative assignment to combine psychology,
                    semiotics and game design into a framework that could later be prototyped in-engine.
